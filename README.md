# FileDrawer

This contains a number of data files in different formats. The goal is to read
the files into memory so that the data is accessible.

Things you will learn or need to know:
* Paths in Ruby
  * File.dirname
  * __FILE__  
* Reading file content into a variable
* Processing a file with different libraries
  * json
  * nokogiri
  * csv
* Write json data to a file

#### Gems

This project also includes the gem Nokogiri. Installation on new systems usually
raises errors. This is a known problem. If you see an error, alert the instructor so that everyone can learn about the installation process together.
Also, read the error feedback, it tries to tell you what to do, so don't panic.

## Getting Started

1. `bundle` to get your gems
2. Write tests/write code:
  * look at the comments in spec files to write tests one at a time
  * write the code in the classes provided
  * rinse & repeat
